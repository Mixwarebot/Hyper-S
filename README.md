- If the printer does not move for a long time during printing, and the nozzle target temperature is 170Â°C, you can try to wait for 3 minutes, and the printer will automatically deal with this problem within 3 minutes.
- But the printer still does not start printing after 5 minutes, you should try to reprint or format the USB flash drive.
